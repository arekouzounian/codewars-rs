# codewars-rs

I've found that I learn best by doing; though [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) is an amazing resource, it helps me most to start writing code in a language to understand it best. 

Diving into a full-blown project in pure Rust is just not realistic for me yet, nor is trying to create optimal solutions on LeetCode, so codewars is my happy medium for writing Rust code. 

In these solutions to (usually pretty simple) problems, I try to embrace the capabilites of the Rust std library as much as possible, but my lifetime of writing in C-like languages might bleed into the code
